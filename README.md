# ddpg-mountaincarcontinuous
DDPG Algorithm for solving MountainCarContinuous


An implementation of DDPG using Keras/TensorFlow to solve the OpenAI Gym MountainCarContinuous-v0 environment, among others.

The program saves the data (rewards and running average of 100 episodes) in Pickel dump which can be processed by the plotter.py program for generation of graphs and animated plots.
